Note: Audio may not work on your machine as it is dependent on local files.
The way I put the files is all in a folder called called sounds,
please specify the directory of the sounds folder in the engine.h.
The constant you should change is AUDIO_BASE_DIRECTORY.

For convenience I have placed all the sounds I used also in the
visual studio project directory under a sounds folder.
